The aim of the Cascade Model is to reliably estimate the number of trips an individual will make for a given trip purpose over an extended period of time, such as 84 days. Like the Zenith Trip Production Model (ZTPM), the Cascade Model uses demographic variables such as occupational status to predict the number of trips but unlike the ZTPM which works at a household level the Cascade model aims to model the trips made by individuals.</p>

The two distributions show significant correlation, including the shape of the curve which has a minimum value at one trip.</p>

                                        		<p class="pragraph">The 'Swinger Model' is the name given to the Trip Distribution Variability Model used within the MOVE AMS. In the same way the Cascade Model extends Zenith’s Trip Production Model, the Swinger Model functions as an extension to the Zenith Trip Distribution Model (ZTDM).</p>
                                        		<p class="pragraph">Trip Distribution is the process of assigning destinations to trips, based on the cost of getting there (distance, time, public transport fare/car parking charges, etc.), and their relative attractiveness (such as number of employees for a home-to-work trip).For the destination variability, the key question identified was:</p>
                                        	
                                            	<p class="pragraph">For a person who has made t trips to d different destinations for a given purpose, and is about to make another trip of that purpose, what is the likelihood that the trip will be to a new (unvisited) destination.</p>
                                                
                                               <p class="pragraph">This likelihood can be expressed as P(d→d+1|t→t+1), which represents the probability P of the number of destinations, d, increasing, given that the number of trips is increasing from t to t+1. The primary aim of the Swinger Model then, is to:</p>
                                               <p class="pragraph">Reliably estimate the number of destinations an individual will have visited for a given trip purpose after a given number of trips</p>
                                               <p class="pragraph">Through analysis of survey data it was determined that this probability needed to be modelled as a function of both d and t. While the relation for this probability may differ depending on the trip maker’s occupation and whether or not it is a weekday or weekend, there was not sufficient data to show this with any confidence. However, a very strong correlation was found with the trip purpose.</p>
                                               <p class="pragraph">The model will assume that each person has only one place of residence. This assumption simplifies the application of the model. Technically, for any to-home trip purposes, only one home zone can be assigned. In contrast, for other trip purposes at least some variability was found, which this model will capture. The purposes considered are:</p>

                                            <p class="pragraph">For these purposes the probability of visiting a new destination is a function of both d and t, provided a trip of that purpose has been made. For each of the purposes with destination variability a function describing the probability of visiting a new destination needs to be obtained. These probabilities were found to correlate most closely with d/t, or the ratio of destinations to trips.</p>
                                           	<p class="pragraph">Mode Choice Variability Model (MCVM)</p>
                                            <p class="pragraph">In Zenith, Mode Choice relates to the competing attractiveness of taking a car, public transport (PT), or walking/cycling, for any given trip. The Mode Choice Variability Model is designed to capture to what extent an individual repeats their choice of mode for different trips. Survey results showed that people do repeat their mode choice between Car and PT, however no such bias was observed for walking/cycling trips.</p>
                                            <p class="pragraph">The MCVM then works by considering each individual to be randomly assigned a mode choice percentile, which indicates where they lie along the Car vs PT spectrum. For example, a person at the 0th percentile will choose PT for every trip, a person at the 100th percentile will always choose Car. At the 20th percentile, a person will choose Car 80-100% of the time for all purposes except Home Based Education and Other Based which have significantly more PT utilisation.</p>
                                            <p class="pragraph">Route Choice Variability Model</p>
                                            <p class="pragraph">Route choice variability is where, for a repeated trip (say, driving to the same destination for work on two consecutive days), different routes are chosen. Due to the limitations of the online-based survey method, however, no data about route choice could be collected, so no route variability could be included. Note that none of the GHTS datasets include any route information either.</p>
                                            <p class="pragraph">From some anecdotal evidence from an A-GPS pilot study performed in Madrid by Cuende Infometrics, however, there appears to be a very limited amount of route choice variability, and so we have adopted the assumption that, for a repeated trip, the same route is always chosen.</p>
